# Data Analysis Projects: EDA, Distribution Comparison, and Regression Analysis

This repository contains three projects that I worked on during my studies at TU Dortmund University. These projects focus on exploratory data analysis (EDA), comparison of distributions, and regression modeling, showcasing the application of statistical techniques to real-world datasets.

## Projects Included

### 1. **EcoWorld Demo**
   - **Objective**: To encourage and facilitate sustainable living practices.
   - **Key Features**:
     - User Profile & Dashboard
     - Carbon Footprint Calculator
     - Sustainable Habit Tracker
     - EcoCommunity Forum
     - Local EcoEvents Calendar
   - **Skills Used**: Data visualization, EDA, and feature implementation.

### 2. **EcoWorld Sustainability Analytics**
   - **Objective**: To apply statistical methods to understand patterns in sustainability data.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Advanced data analysis
     - Statistical modeling and interpretation
   - **Skills Used**: Statistical testing, hypothesis validation, and analytical reasoning.

### 3. **Regression Analysis on Seoul Bike Sharing Data**
   - **Objective**: To analyze bike-sharing demand data using regression models.
   - **Dataset**: [Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand)
   - **Key Tasks**:
     - EDA: Scatter plots, correlation analysis
     - Model Building: Linear regression and variable selection
     - Model Evaluation: Residual plots, multicollinearity checks, and VIF analysis
   - **Skills Used**: Regression modeling, model selection, statistical evaluation.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Programming Languages: R
- Techniques: EDA, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, variable selection
